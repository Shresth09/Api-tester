Here's a revised message:

"Dear [Senior's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out to you with utmost respect and humility regarding the CSC Fest poster that was recently shared. I truly appreciate the effort that has gone into organizing the event.

However, I noticed that the map of India in the poster may not be entirely accurate. If it's not too much trouble, would it be possible to consider updating it? I'd be more than happy to provide any assistance or resources that might be helpful.

Thank you so much for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]"

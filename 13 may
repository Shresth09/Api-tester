Subject: Request for Map Update for CSC Fest Poster

Dear [Associate's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to request your assistance with the CSC Fest poster that includes a map of India. Upon reviewing the poster, I noticed that the map may not be entirely accurate.

Would it be possible to update the map to ensure its accuracy for future usage? I would greatly appreciate your help in this matter.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

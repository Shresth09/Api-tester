Ah, I understand now! You want the "RQM" text to appear directly on the border of the .custom-box, like a label cut into the border itself, as depicted in your image.
To achieve this, we need to use a slightly different approach with CSS. Here's how:
1. CSS Modifications:
.custom-box {
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  padding: 10px;
  margin: 10px 0;
  border-radius: 5px;
  width: fit-content;
  box-sizing: content-box;
  position: relative; /* Add relative positioning */
}

.rqm-label {
  position: absolute;
  top: -10px; /* Adjust based on border thickness and font size */
  left: 10px; /* Adjust based on desired placement */
  background-color: white; /* Match the background color */
  padding: 0 5px; /* Adjust padding to fit the text */
  font-size: 0.9em; /* Adjust font size as needed */
}

/* Existing styles */
.description-score-custom-field {
  /* ... your existing styles ... */
}

.progress-container {
  /* ... your existing styles ... */
}

.progress-bar {
  /* ... your existing styles ... */
}

.aui-button {
  /* ... your existing styles ... */
}

2. HTML Modifications:
Keep the HTML the same as before:
<div class="custom-box">
  <div class="rqm-label">RQM</div>
  <div class="description-score-custom-field">
    Description score:
    <span id="no-score-text" style="color: gray;">Loading...</span>
    <div class="progress-container">
      <div id="score-progress-bar" class="progress-bar"></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div><a id="show-popup" class="aui-button">Analyze Description</a></div>
  <div id="hidden-description" style="display: none;"></div>
</div>

Explanation of Changes:
 * top: -10px; (Adjustable): This is the key change. We're moving the rqm-label up to overlap the border. Adjust the -10px value to fine-tune the positioning so that the "RQM" text appears to be cut into the border. The exact value will depend on your border thickness and font size.
 * left: 10px; (Adjustable): This controls the horizontal position of the label. Adjust it to place the "RQM" text where you want it along the top border.
 * background-color: white;: This is crucial. It covers the border where the "RQM" text is placed, giving the illusion that the text is cut into the border. Make sure it matches the background color of your page.
 * padding: 0 5px;: Adjust this padding to control the space around the "RQM" text. You might need to make it smaller or larger depending on the font size.
Important Notes:
 * Fine-Tuning top: The most important part is getting the top value right. This might require some experimentation to get it to look perfect.
 * Background Color: Double-check that the background-color of the rqm-label matches the background of your page.
 * Border Thickness: If you change the border thickness of the .custom-box, you'll likely need to adjust the top value of the rqm-label accordingly.
With these adjustments, the "RQM" text should appear as if it's cut into the border of your .custom-box, as shown in your image.

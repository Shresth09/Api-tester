Alright, let's start with a very basic "Hello World" example in a VM file, focusing on simplicity and getting it to display on your Jira issue page.
1. Plugin Module (atlassian-plugin.xml):
We'll use a webPanel to inject our "Hello World" message into the right sidebar.
<web-panel key="hello-world-panel" location="atl.jira.view.issue.right.context" weight="10">
    <label key="hello.world.title"/>
    <resource type="velocity" name="content" location="templates/hello-world.vm"/>
</web-panel>

2. Velocity Template (templates/hello-world.vm):
<div id="hello-world-container">
    <p>Hello, World!</p>
</div>

Explanation:
 * web-panel:
   * This module type tells Jira to create a panel in the specified location.
   * key: A unique identifier for your panel.
   * location: atl.jira.view.issue.right.context places it in the right sidebar of the issue page.
   * weight: Determines the order of panels in the sidebar.
   * resource: Specifies the VM template to use.
 * hello-world.vm:
   * This is a simple HTML file with a "Hello, World!" message.
Steps to Implement:
 * Create the Plugin Structure:
   * If you haven't already, create a basic Jira plugin project structure.
 * Create the atlassian-plugin.xml:
   * Place the XML code above in your atlassian-plugin.xml file.
 * Create the templates Directory:
   * Create a templates directory in your plugin's resources folder.
 * Create the hello-world.vm:
   * Place the VM code above in a file named hello-world.vm within the templates directory.
 * Build and Install:
   * Build your plugin and install it in your Jira instance.
 * View an Issue:
   * Navigate to a Jira issue, and you should see the "Hello, World!" message in the right sidebar.
Key Points:
 * This is the simplest possible example to ensure your plugin is working and that you understand the basic flow.
 * Once you have this working, you can gradually add more complex logic and functionality.
 * If you do not see the hello world message, ensure that the plugin is enabled, and that you have cleared your browser cache.
 * If you are editing the atlassian-plugin.xml or the vm file, you will need to re-install the plugin for the changes to take effect.

Great question! In the example I provided, the `displayCustomMessage` function is intended to log the message to the console. 

To show a flag in the Jira UI when a new issue is created, you can use the Atlassian API to create a flag. Here's an example using Jira's JavaScript API to display a flag with a custom message:

1. **Add JavaScript to your plugin**: Create a JavaScript file in your plugin project.

2. **Modify your plugin code**: Adjust your plugin code to include a JavaScript file that handles the flag creation.

Here's an example of the JavaScript code to display the flag:

```javascript
AJS.toInit(function () {
    // Listen for issue created event
    JIRA.bind(JIRA.Events.NEW_CONTENT_ADDED, function (e, context, reason) {
        if (reason === JIRA.CONTENT_ADDED_REASON.issueCreated) {
            // Display custom flag
            AJS.flag({
                type: 'info',
                title: 'Custom Message',
                body: 'Issue has been created successfully with your custom message.',
                close: 'auto'
            });
        }
    });
});
```

3. **Include the JavaScript file in your plugin**: Ensure the JavaScript file is included in your plugin descriptor (atlassian-plugin.xml).

Here's an example snippet of the `atlassian-plugin.xml` file:

```xml
<web-resource key="my-custom-flag-resource" name="My Custom Flag Resource">
    <dependency>com.atlassian.auiplugin:ajs</dependency>
    <resource type="download" name="my-custom-flag.js" location="/js/my-custom-flag.js"/>
    <context>atl.general</context>
</web-resource>
```

4. **Deploy your plugin**: Package and deploy your plugin to your Jira instance. Make sure your plugin is enabled.

With these steps, whenever a new issue is created, a custom flag with your message will be displayed in the Jira UI.
